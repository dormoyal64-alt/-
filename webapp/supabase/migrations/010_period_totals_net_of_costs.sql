-- period_totals: make "my profit" mean profit
--
-- profit_agorot was the sum of business_share_agorot — my cut of each job after
-- the contractor and the referral company, and nothing else. It never took off
-- the fuel, the helper, or the advertising that bought the leads, so the
-- dashboard's "הרווח שלי היום" sat above the truth and never moved when ad
-- spend was entered.
--
-- profit_agorot is now what is actually left. gross_profit_agorot keeps the old
-- figure alongside it, and the costs are returned separately so a screen can
-- show the subtraction rather than just the result.
