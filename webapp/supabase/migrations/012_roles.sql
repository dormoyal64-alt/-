-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Two kinds of user: the owner, and office staff
--
-- The point of this is that a clerk can run the day — open jobs, manage
-- contractors, chase customers — without seeing what the business earns. That
-- has to hold in the database, not in the menu: hiding a link does nothing
-- against someone typing a URL or reading the API directly.
--
-- Three lines are drawn, in order of how much they are worth:
--
--   1. Every report and total is a function, and each now refuses to run for a
--      non-owner. This is where "how much came in" actually lives.
--   2. The tables that are nothing but money — settlements, ad spend, referral
--      companies — are invisible to a clerk under RLS.
--   3. A job's money (final price, the contractor's cut, my share) is only
--      filled in when the job is closed, so a clerk sees open jobs only. Those
--      columns are null on every row they can read.
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

alter table profiles
  add column if not exists role text not null default 'owner';

-- 'admin' was the old default and meant the same thing
update profiles set role = 'owner' where role in ('admin', '');

alter table profiles drop constraint if exists profiles_role_check;
alter table profiles add constraint profiles_role_check check (role in ('owner', 'clerk'));

-- New sign-ups are clerks. An account that can see the money is something the
-- owner grants on purpose, never something a new row gets by default.
