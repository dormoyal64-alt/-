-- Advertising paid for a stretch of time, not just a day
--
-- A monthly ad budget is one payment covering thirty days. Recorded as a single
-- day it makes that day look ruinous and the other twenty-nine look free, which
-- is worse than not recording it: the daily profit figure becomes noise.
--
-- So a spend row now covers a range, and any report asks for the slice of it
-- that falls inside the range being reported. Existing rows cover one day —
-- exactly what they meant before — so nothing already entered changes value.

-- What advertising cost between two dates
--
-- Each row contributes its daily rate times the number of its own days that
-- fall inside the window asked about. A month's budget queried for one day
-- gives one day of it.
